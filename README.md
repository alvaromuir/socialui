# Social interest group UI developemnt environment

This is the dev environment for a social interest website. Will include creative elements, and html/js/css components.
Based on [FireShell](http://getfireshell.com/)

Requirements:
	+ NodeJS/NPM
	+ Sass
	+ Grunt
	+ Jade

To test and run:

```
	$ grunt-build.command
	$ bower install
```

The project is served from the app/ directory. Therefore, it can be run locally by navigating to that directory from your browser without running th built in server - however there may be issues with relative links and images.
